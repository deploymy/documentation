# DeployStack Documentation

DeployStack converts your **Docker configurations** into **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) templates for multiple cloud providers. Whether you have a docker-compose.yml file or docker run commands, it generates the necessary AWS CloudFormation, Render.com Blueprint, or DigitalOcean specifications for example. This lets you and your users deploy the same application consistently across different cloud platforms using their native deployment mechanisms, **without needing to manually create** each provider's infrastructure.

## Get Started

DeployStack simplifies cloud deployment through three key steps: configure your Docker setup, translate docker compose or run command to IaC templates, and enable one-click deployment for your users. Start by understanding the core concepts and how to integrate DeployStack with your repository.

### Core Concepts

### Supported Cloud Providers

DeployStack generates infrastructure templates for major cloud providers, each optimized for their specific deployment patterns. AWS CloudFormation templates use Fargate for containerized workloads, DigitalOcean leverages App Platform, and Render.com implements Blueprints for smooth deployment. While translating your docker command to Infrastructure as Code by using [docker-to-iac](/docs/docker-to-iac/index.md) module, you can choose your target provider.

### DeployStack Ecosystem

DeployStack consists of several integrated components that work together to enable consistent Docker to cloud deployment. Each repository serves a specific purpose in the ecosystem:
